TODO:

Experiment with PZ fitter time range

For E_lamda, subtract total mean value of lamda before applying correction?
(like is done in PSAcal, between sp 1601 and 1401)

Library-PSA for detector IDs 30, 50 (have poor A/E selectivity)


[ ADD Gretina4A support to: compress*, decompress*, run_check, siginspect, prebuild ]
[ anl_firmware: crate 2 slot 6 -> detectors 29, 30, 34, [37], 44  (37 disabled) ]

drift-time cuts??
c2p1d4 (ch 32) PZ/DCR instability
10 Mz noise subtraction
burst cut

track down rundiff / rundiff2 bug in DS0

=====================================

How to handle chs with no pulser?
            - 42; 142, *138*
           ?- use calibration runs?
           ?- scale 138 LG slopes from HG?
           ?- why no pulsers in 138? 38 sees plenty. Is it just these runs?

dCoding:
get rid of oldTime in eventbuild.c?

        add a check on "expected pulser counts" based on duration of run
        investigate rate-oscillation runs
        improved way of finding narrowest peak in CTprocess/ep_finalize

        EnergyCal stability
        Veto logic
        LN-fill (20 mins) and noise-burst veto
        Reading stage 1 baselines, HV currents?
        General clean-up, e.g. too many little undocumented hacks

Tuning/results:
        Check/tune data cleaning cuts
              ?- does slope cut remove early low-ampl pulses due to walk?
              ?- increase margin of error for baseline, rms, slope, pulser-tag energy?

Some files to process:

   - DS0/DS1 without trigger card???  Try prebuilding?
             2016-1-20-P3KJR_Run9768  - Ge delta-time = 6440 s
             2016-2-7-P3KJR_Run10329  - More than 200 sub-events in built event!
             2016-3-14-P3KJR_Run11944 - both polarities? Multiple pulser peaks
             
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some thoughts about the DCR cut
===============================

- The Signal acceptance  of the DCR cut should be evaluated with the DE peak, not continuum or FE peak
- Need pileup rejection of calib signals to evaluate acceptance?
- Need to cut on baseline value and slope of calib signals to evaluate acceptance?
- Does calib signal acceptance overlap with Li signal degradation / bb peak acceptance?
- Using presummed (longer) signals gives some increase in DCR sensitivity, probably 20% - 40% or so
- The delayed charge appears to continue for ~25 us in at least some cases. Need to check that for more detectors...
- Should be able to extract rough radius from drift time, comparing e.g. t(1-70%) expt vs sim
- Temperature-dependence of DCR release time?

git:

instead of "svn co" do
git clone https://github.com/mppmu/GAT.git

instead of "svn update" do
git pull   (do this before a push?)

instead of "svn commit" do
git commit [files]
git push

also
git add <filename>
If you want to set the editor only for Git, do either (you donâ€™t need both):

Set core.editor in your Git config: git config --global core.editor "emacs"
Set the GIT_EDITOR environment variable: export GIT_EDITOR=emacs
